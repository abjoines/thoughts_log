        <p>is an experimental microsite to assist you in a sort of mindfulness practice. 
        One mindfulness concept which I’ve come across, put plainly, is to acknowledge and release your thoughts - 
        especially negative ones. This is a place where you can write down and let 
        go of your thoughts. It’s completely impermanent and more convenient than a physical piece of paper.

        I am currently ideating on some potential new features - such as a storing your thoughts
        so they can be filtered through and downloaded.
